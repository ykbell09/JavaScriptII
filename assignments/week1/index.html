        <h2>Words of Wisdom</h2>
        <p>It’s always fascinating to me how carrying a pack changes the way in which I hike. Physically, as well as emotionally. I
        find that the weight changes the way that I step, creating a methodical, purposeful walk that carries with it the feel
        of a pilgrimage — something of spiritual journey; a mission of self-discovery. I put effort into the balance of the
        weight, minimizing the inevitable discomfort, learning through every step how to be with this experience that is so far
        outside of my everyday existence.</p>
        <p>In the wilderness, nothing matters aside from the here and now. The moment you are in is the most important moment, and
        the people you are with become the most important people. Everyone you see is brethren; you all share a connection that
        can only be gained by venturing off the grid. All of a sudden your cell phone doesn’t matter; you couldn’t care less
        about your inbox, or your mailbox, or your anything else. Your house could burn down and you would cease to care until
        you were back on the grid. In fact, it’s quite possible that you would care far less, regardless — after all, the
        mountains want you back.</p>
